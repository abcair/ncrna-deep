#Exploring non-coding RNA functions with deep learning tools
Scripts and datasets to reproduce the experiment reported in the paper

#Datasets

Two datasets has been adopted in the experiments, a novel Rfam dataset 

```console
Rscript dataset-preparation.R
```

this will generate three fasta files `x_train.fasta`, `x_val.fasta`, and `x_test.fasta` and the distribution graph among Rfam classes `class-distribution.pdf`.
